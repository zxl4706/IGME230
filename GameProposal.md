# Game Proposal for Shape Fits All

## High Concept

As different polygons comes to the player's polygon in the middle of the screen, the player have to quickly his/her polygon shape to match the ones that are about to touch him/her to stay alive!

## Genre
    
Casual, Arcade, Rhythm

## Platform
    
Universal
  
## Story
    
The idea of this game is to stimulate player's reaction time. As player start off playing this game, the pace to process incoming polygon's shape will be slow but as the score gets higher, the pace will slowly increase thus excites and stimulate the player to focus a lot more. I want this game to be something casual and people can play minutes before classes or bus arriving. A game that's not heavy for the taste yet not so boring either.
    
## Esthetics
  
I think that this game can go simple in terms of it's graphics style. It can be really simple with solid color and a little animation to smoothen the transition between each action of the player and the game. The polygons will be solid color along with gradiant smooth background color. The sound will be 8-bit conducting sound effects in the interaction of gameplay. Overall, the game itself will need sound effects which is 8-bits along with background music which should be a combination of smooth and up-beat. The user-interface should be simple yet precise with basic menu and in-game score box at the top. Four button control to change into four different polygon to face incoming polygons.
    
## Gameplay
  
### Mechanics
    
For the main objective of the game, players just have to be able to keep up with the pace and difficulty level that they are on. One added feature to hint the players as to what rhythm they should sync to is the slight vibration animation of the player's polygon. Other than that, it really just depends on the reaction and mental process speed of each players.

### Controls

Players will be using WASD or Arrow Keys to change into whatever polygon shape that they want. It should be entirely keyboard and for mobile version there should be a section for touch screen with the four shapes to change into.

### Learning

Players will be able to get a brief explaination from the instruction section of the menu about the objective and controls of the game. The rest of the mechanics of the game will have to depend on player's reaction and adaptability. After one or two tries players should at the very least guess how to play the game.
