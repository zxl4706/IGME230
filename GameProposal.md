# Game Proposal for Shape Fits All

## High Concept

As different polygons comes to the player's polygon in the middle of the screen, the player have to quickly his/her polygon shape to match the ones that are about to touch the defensive objective to stay alive!

## Genre
    
Casual, Arcade, Rhythm

## Platform
    
Universal
  
## Story
    
The idea of this game is to stimulate player's reaction time. As player start off playing this game, the pace to process incoming polygon's shape will be slow but as the score gets higher, the pace will slowly increase thus excites and stimulate the player to focus a lot more. I want this game to be something casual and people can play minutes before classes or bus arriving. A game that's not heavy for the taste yet not so boring either.
    
## Esthetics
  
I think that this game can go simple in terms of it's graphics style. It can be really simple with solid color and a little animation to smoothen the transition between each action of the player and the game. The polygons will be solid color along with gradiant smooth background color. The sound will be 8-bit conducting sound effects in the interaction of gameplay. Overall, the game itself will need sound effects which is 8-bits along with background music which should be a combination of smooth and up-beat. The user-interface should be simple yet precise with basic menu and in-game score box at the top. Four button control to change into four different polygon to face incoming polygons.
    
## Gameplay
  
### Mechanics
    
For the main objective of the game, players just have to be able to keep up with the pace and difficulty level that they are on. One added feature to hint the players as to what rhythm they should sync to is the slight vibration animation of the player's polygon. Other than that, it really just depends on the reaction and mental process speed of each players.

Player would have to first be able to interchange between different polygons so they could match the ones that have spawned onto the screen and destroy them so the player would not lose health. The players may also shoot bullets that can only hit the matching polygon that the user is in. And the objective may be to protect the center object in the screen from damaged by the incoming polygons. Each polygon may be lowered in opacity based on which polygon that the player is in to tell the player that those polygon may not be targetable unless player change into the matching polygon with control.

### Controls

Players will be using WASD or Arrow Keys to move around the screen and using the number pads to change into whatever polygon shape that they want. It should be entirely keyboard friendly. There also should be UI legends on the screen for the gameplay level, score, and the different polygons that the player can change into by pressing what kind of keys. Then users may use the mouse to face the direction and shoot the bullets by pressing the left keys. Players may also press a key which will later be instructed in the game to switch between the polygon and "dimensions" that each type of the polygon belongs in. 

### Learning

Players will be able to get a brief explaination from the instruction section of the menu about the objective and controls of the game. The rest of the mechanics of the game will have to depend on player's reaction and adaptability. After one or two tries players should at the very least guess how to play the game.
